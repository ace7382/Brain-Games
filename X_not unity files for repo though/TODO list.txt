Something is wonky with the HP bar in battle if you enter battle with an injured unit. I think. Might be something wrong with
	damage calculations instead? Had a unit that should've take 9 dmg go from full MH of 110 to 23 on the first attack of the battle

Inventory button can be double clicked and cause problems

Inventory scrollview doesn't load scrolled to the top

Inventory Scrollview needs a small offset at the bottom of the list bc the number on item icons goes past the "end"

in Free aspect mode, the battle background and ability scrolls are not in the correct spots. Probably not anchored correctly.

clicking on the back (like not the panel) of an inventory screen should close it

There's a visual jump/awkward placeing of the scroll list when:
	going to the item target page > scrolling down > going back > opening a different item with a different target list.
	Should set the scroll view's position to 0 (in code when opening/setting up the list) and the y pivot to 1 (in inspector)

Currently the consumable target page for stat changing items will show values with mods like equipment.
	So using an item to raise a stat by 10% for a stat with 10 normal points and 10 points raised by equipement 
	will look like the following:
	20 >> 21 (instad of >> 22) bc the 10% is being applied to the pre-stat mods value. This just looks incorrect. Probably need a full
	overhaul of the view to fix this though ðŸ™ƒ. Base stats + stats w/ mods plus probs exp bars too?
	
If an item runs out on use, have it pause after updating the cards before it closes everything

Probably will redo the UI anyway, but the party cards don't update the exp/hp bars on item use/equip

If an ability charge is flying toward an ability and the owner of that ability dies, the charge's target is destroyed resulting
	in an error. Doesn't break anything as far as I could tell though.
